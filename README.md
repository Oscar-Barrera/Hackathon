The inaugural UF AI Days Hackathon gave its 234 participants 24 hours to create a machine learning project to combat a social inequality and address one of the 17 defined sustainable development goals. Our project used census data on disadvantaged populations in Boston and created a clustering algorithm to determine the neighborhood where a community outreach center ought to be built in order to help those who need it the most.

In a team of two, our first task was to decode the GeoJson data into a format which we could use for clustering. From here, we reduced the dimensionality of the data using principal component analysis and found the correlation matrix between the different features (i.e., low income, disabled, elderly, etcâ€¦). We then loaded in geographical data for the distribution of public schools and community centers in Boston and found the neighborhood which has the least resources and the most disadvantaged population to propose a new community outreach center.

Winning the first-place prize of $10,000 and attending the subsequent banquet with NVIDIA representatives has motivated me to further my knowledge of machine learning and AI. A news article about the event can be found here:
